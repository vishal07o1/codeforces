He wants to make postcards with his own hands. For this purpose, he has a sheet of paper of size $$$w \times h$$$, which can be cut into pieces.</p><p>Polycarp can cut any sheet of paper $$$w \times h$$$ that he has in only two cases: </p><ul> <li> If $$$w$$$ is even, then he can cut the sheet in half and get two sheets of size $$$\frac{w}{2} \times h$$$; </li><li> If $$$h$$$ is even, then he can cut the sheet in half and get two sheets of size $$$w \times \frac{h}{2}$$$; </li></ul><p>If $$$w$$$ and $$$h$$$ are even at the same time, then Polycarp can cut the sheet according to any of the rules above.</p><p>After cutting a sheet of paper, the total number of sheets of paper is increased by $$$1$$$.</p><p>Help Polycarp to find out if he can cut his sheet of size $$$w \times h$$$ at into $$$n$$$ or more pieces, using only the rules described above.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><div class="section-title">Input</div><p>The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.
